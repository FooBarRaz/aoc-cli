## Description

This is a set of command line tools to help automate repetitive tasks and speed up your daily Advent of Code workflow.

## Installation

To install the application globally:

```

## Usage

To use the application, run the following command after installing the CLI:

```bash
aoc
```

This will display the help menu, which includes a list of available commands and their descriptions.

### Commands

#### new

Create a new item with specified year, day, and an optional template.

```bash
aoc new <basePath> -y <year> -d <day> [-t <template>]
```

- `<basePath>`: The location in which to create files and directories.
- `-y, --year <year>`: The year for the problem.
- `-d, --day <day>`: The day of the problem. Must be a number between 1 and 25.
- `-t, --template [template]`: Specify a template (optional). Defaults to 'typescript'. For more information on adding templates, see [Custom Templates](#custom-templates).
- `-s, --session [session]`: Specify a session token (optional). Defaults to the value of the `AOC_SESSION` environment variable. For more information on session tokens, see [Puzzle Input](#puzzle-input).

Example:

```bash
aoc new src/problems 2023 15
```

### Custom Templates
You can create custom templates for any language, framework, or style by adding a new directory to the `templates` directory. The name of the directory will be the name of the template. Inside the directory, you can add any files or directories you want to be created when the template is used. You can use the following variables in your file and directory names to have them replaced with the appropriate values: 

- `{{year}}`: The year of the problem.
- `{{day}}`: The day of the problem.
- `{{puzzleInput}}`: The puzzle input for the problem. Refer to [Puzzle Input](#puzzle-input) for more information.


### Puzzle Input

You can specify a session token to be used to retrieve your own puzzle input for a problem. This can be done in one of two ways:

1. Set the `AOC_SESSION` environment variable to your session token.
2. Pass the session token as an argument to the `new` command using the `-s` or `--session` flag.


You can get your session token by logging into your Advent of Code account and viewing the page source. Search for the string `session=` and copy the value of the `value` attribute of the input element. This is your session token.
